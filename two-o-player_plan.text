# Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

# Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

# The game doesnâ€™t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other playerâ€™s score is.

# module question_maker / looping / pick random 2 numbers from 1-20 / and random operator (+ - / *)
  # protected answer
# answer detector / get the answer and match the question 
  # initialize answer / get the protected answer from question_maker / and compare it and puts mention
# lives counting if answer is correct pass, wrong -= 1
# each player turn / take the turn each players time
  # show the lives / and say it who's turn now
